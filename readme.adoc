= K2, a kernel for embedded C++ projects

== What this claims to be
*K2 is a small C++ FIFO task manager that unapologetically refers to its central object as a kernel, despite making no claim to operating systems, privilege rings, or academic rigor.*

It exists to enqueue work, dequeue it deterministically, and get out of the way. Built by an autodidact with more curiosity than credentials and a preference for things that are simple, explicit, and fast over things that are fashionable.
